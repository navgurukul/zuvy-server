230	Fuel Station Circuit	Problem Statement\n\nA logistics company operates a fleet of delivery trucks on a circular route with n gas stations. The i-th station has gas[i] amount of fuel, and it costs cost[i] fuel to travel from the i-th station to the next (i+1)-th station.\n\nYou have a truck with an unlimited gas tank and it starts with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. You begin the journey with an empty tank.\n\nGiven two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\n\nInput Format\nFirst line: Integer array gas representing fuel at each station\nSecond line: Integer array cost representing cost to reach next station\n\nOutput Format\nReturn an integer representing the starting station index, or -1 if impossible\n\nExamples\nExample 1:\n\nInput: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nStart at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\nTherefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]\nOutput: -1\n	Medium	24	\nn == gas.length == cost.length\n1 <= n <= 10^5\n0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4	2025-11-20 10:04:15.519+00	2025-11-20 10:04:15.519+00	0	{}	\N	\N
231	Product Analytics Dashboard	Problem Statement\n\nA product analytics platform needs to identify trending items. Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.\n\nInput Format\nFirst line: Integer array nums\nSecond line: Integer k\n\nOutput Format\nReturn an integer array of the k most frequent elements\n\nExamples\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2\nOutput: [1,2]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1], k = 1\nOutput: [1]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2\nOutput: [1,2]\n	Medium	24	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4\nk is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array]\nIt is guaranteed that the answer is unique	2025-11-20 10:11:43.596+00	2025-11-20 10:11:43.596+00	0	{}	\N	\N
232	Message Priority Sorter	Problem Statement\nA messaging application needs to sort messages based on character frequency for spam detection. Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.\n\nReturn the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.\nInput Format\n\nA string s consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits\nOutput Format\nReturn a string sorted by character frequency in decreasing order\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "tree"\nOutput: "eert"\nExplanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.\nSo 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = "cccaaa"\nOutput: "aaaccc"\nExplanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.\nNote that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = "Aabb"\nOutput: "bbAa"\nExplanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.\nNote that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.\n	Medium	24	1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5\ns consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits	2025-11-20 10:22:39.583+00	2025-11-20 10:48:18.593+00	0	{}	\N	\N
233	PRATIK String Character Difference Validator	A text processing system for a document management platform needs to validate string similarity. The system receives a list of strings where all strings have the same length. Your task is to determine if there exist exactly 2 strings that differ by only 1 character at the same index position.\n\nGiven a list of strings dict where all the strings are of the same length, return true if there are 2 strings that only differ by 1 character in the same index, otherwise return false.\nInput Format\nA list of strings dict where all strings have equal length\nOutput Format\nReturn true if there exist 2 strings differing by exactly 1 character at the same index, otherwise return false\nExample 1:\n\nInput: ["abcd","acbd","aacd"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Strings "abcd" and "aacd" differ only by one character in the index 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: ["ab","cd","yz"]\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: ["abcd","cccc","abyd","abab"]\nOutput: true\n	Medium	36	The number of characters in dict <= 10^5\ndict[i].length == dict[j].length\ndict[i] should be unique\ndict[i] contains only lowercase English letters\n	2025-11-20 10:40:14.049+00	2025-11-20 11:43:58.476+00	1	{}	\N	\N
