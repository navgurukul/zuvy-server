 * Cheap, deterministic near-duplicate detection for generated MCQs.
 *

 * two places and both need catching:
 *
 *   - inside one batch, where nothing checked at all;
 *   - across sibling batches, which cannot see each other's rows until they
 *     are inserted and indexed.
 *
 * The shape being caught is a stem restated with the wording varied and the
 * same option set shuffled into a new order - what a model produces when asked
 * twice for a question on the same narrow concept. Option order is therefore
 * discarded before comparing, or a shuffle alone would hide the repeat.
 *
 * Embeddings would also catch it, but they cost a network round trip per
 * question and fail open when the vector store is down. Token overlap is free,
 * synchronous and good enough for restatements of one stem, which is the
 * actual problem. Semantic retrieval still runs over the existing bank; this
 * is the check that cannot fail open.
 *
 * Tuning note: every rule here is a similarity threshold over token sets, with
 * no knowledge of any particular topic or question. The thresholds are
 * exported so they can be moved from one place.
